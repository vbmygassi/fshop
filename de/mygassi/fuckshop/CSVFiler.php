 Salesfraggles use excel and no admin panels. 
 Excel is wrong: no import or such. 
	Excel it again plz.

 Import is from Excel CSV.
 Export is to Excel CSV.

 Nobody, i really mean NOBODY is going to click an "Adminpanel". 
 And especially NOT YOU.
 And than this is good in fact.
 
 [ Adminpanels usually start with a "user: pass" combination and groups and policies and access control lists and such and i really do not think adminpanels make us happy
